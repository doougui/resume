Being into software development for over 4 years, I managed to ship products which generated value and eased the life of more than 5000 users whilst improving the quality of existing software and creating new, valuable software from the beginning.
Most of my experience comes down to working with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native and Next.js.
